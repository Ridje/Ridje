### Hi there 👋
My name is Ilya, I live in Moscow. I am pretty experienced Devops and 1C-developer but now I decided to switch to android-development.
Wish me luck 😺

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on [Coin Monitor (Android/Java)](https://github.com/Ridje/coinMonitor) and [Your anime list (Android/Kotlin)] (https://github.com/Ridje/YourAnimeList)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with websockets in RxJava, if you know how to improve [Coin Monitor (Android/Java)](https://github.com/Ridje/coinMonitor) architecture - let me know.
- ⚡ Fun fact: This is big russian cat Floppa. He is amazing. What do you think about him?

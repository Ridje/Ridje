### Hi there 👋
My name is Ilya, I live in Moscow. I am pretty experienced Devops and 1C-developer but now I decided to switch to android-development.
Wish me luck 😺.

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on [Your Anime List (Android/Kotlin)](https://github.com/Ridje/YourAnimeList) and [Coin Monitor (Android/Java)](https://github.com/Ridje/coinMonitor)
- 🏢 Test for [Moscow Credit Bank](https://mkb.ru/) - [rates getter](https://github.com/Ridje/mkb_test)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with websockets in RxJava, if you know how to improve [Coin Monitor (Android/Java)](https://github.com/Ridje/coinMonitor) websockets calls/restart - let me know.
- ⚡ Fun fact: This is big russian cat Floppa. He is amazing. What do you think about him?
